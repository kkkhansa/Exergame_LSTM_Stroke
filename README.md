# Exergame for Stroke Rehabilitation using LSTM-based Hand Gesture Recognition

- by Shabrina Al Khansa

## Purpose
1. Undergraduate Thesis
2. Creating an exergame that can be used for home rehabilitation


## Change log

3 June 2025: 

## Improvement needed (3 June 2025)
1. Connect the predicted gesture into keymap (character control)
2. Resize the item (DONE)
3. Add fuction to handle collecting item target (objective)
4. Add next level screen 
5. Add trial and level 2

## Notes
The hand gesture used in this exergame is based on stroke patients needs, focusing on MMT 3-5. Further development needed.
